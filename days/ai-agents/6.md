# Day 6: Working with Tools and APIs: Extending Agent Capabilities

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **What are Tools?** Anything an agent can use to interact with the world (e.g., search engines, calculators, APIs).
*   **Creating Custom Tools:** How to create your own custom tools for your agents.
*   **Using Existing Tools:** Leveraging the vast ecosystem of pre-built tools.
*   **Tool Calling:** How agents decide which tool to use and when.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

Today, you will learn how to give your agents superpowers by connecting them to tools and APIs. You will create your own custom tool and learn how to use existing tools to extend your agent's capabilities.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Code Generation:** "Write the Python code for a custom LangChain tool that gets the current weather for a given city."
*   **Tool Design:** "I want to build an agent that can post on Twitter. What would the tool for this look like?"
*   **Security:** "What are the security risks of giving an agent access to a tool that can execute arbitrary code, and how can these risks be mitigated?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Tool:** A function or API that an agent can call to get information or perform an action.
*   **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
*   **Tool Calling:** The process by which an agent decides which tool to use and with what arguments.
