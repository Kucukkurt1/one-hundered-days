# Day 9: Evaluating and Debugging AI Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **Challenges in Evaluating Agents:** Why it's so hard to evaluate agent performance.
*   **Metrics for Agent Evaluation:** Key metrics to track when evaluating your agents.
*   **Debugging Techniques:** How to debug your agents when they're not behaving as expected.
*   **Observability Tools:** Using tools like LangSmith to get insights into your agent's behavior.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

Today, you will learn how to evaluate and debug your AI agents. You will understand the challenges in agent evaluation and learn about the tools and techniques that can help you build more reliable agents.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Metrics:** "What are the pros and cons of using metrics like task success rate and user satisfaction to evaluate an agent?"
*   **Debugging:** "My agent is stuck in a loop. What are some debugging steps I can take to identify the problem?"
*   **Observability:** "How can I use an observability tool to trace the execution of my agent and understand its decision-making process?"

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Evaluation:** The process of assessing the performance of an AI agent.
*   **Debugging:** The process of identifying and fixing errors in an AI agent.
*   **Observability:** The ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its external outputs.
