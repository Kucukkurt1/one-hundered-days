# Day 7: Memory and State Management in Agents

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **The Importance of Memory:** Why agents need memory to perform complex tasks.
*   **Types of Memory:** Short-term memory (for the current conversation) and long-term memory (for storing information over time).
*   **Implementing Memory:** How to add memory to your agents using frameworks like LangChain.
*   **Vector Stores:** Using vector stores for efficient long-term memory retrieval.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

Today, you will learn how to give your agents a memory. You will understand the difference between short-term and long-term memory and learn how to implement both in your agents.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Conceptual:** "Explain the concept of a vector store and why it's useful for long-term memory in AI agents."
*   **Practical:** "Write the Python code to add conversation history to a LangChain agent."
*   **Design:** "Design a memory system for an agent that needs to remember user preferences over a long period of time."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **Memory:** The ability of an agent to store and retrieve information from past interactions.
*   **Short-Term Memory:** The ability of an agent to remember information within a single conversation.
*   **Long-Term Memory:** The ability of an agent to remember information across multiple conversations.
*   **Vector Store:** A database that stores information as high-dimensional vectors, allowing for efficient similarity search.
