# Day 1: Introduction to AI Agents and Autonomous Systems

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **What is an AI Agent?**
*   **History of Agents:** From symbolic AI to modern LLM-based agents.
*   **Types of Agents:** Simple reflex agents, model-based agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, and learning agents.
*   **Key Components of an Agent:** Perception, action, and decision-making.
*   **Introduction to Autonomous Systems:** How agents fit into the broader picture.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

By the end of today, you will have a solid understanding of what AI agents are, their key components, and how they fit into the larger landscape of autonomous systems.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Explain it to me like I'm 5:** "What's an AI agent, and how is it different from a regular computer program?"
*   **Scenario-based:** "Imagine a smart thermostat that learns your preferences. What type of agent would it be and why?"
*   **Deep Dive:** "Compare and contrast the decision-making process of a utility-based agent with a goal-based agent."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **AI Agent:** An autonomous entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through actuators to achieve its goals.
*   **Autonomous System:** A system that can operate and make decisions without human intervention.
*   **LLM (Large Language Model):** A type of artificial intelligence that can understand and generate human-like text.
