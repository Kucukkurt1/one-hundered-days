# Day 5: Deep Dive into Agent Architecture: ReAct, MRKL, and Self-Correction

## 📝 Today's Agenda

*   **ReAct (Reason and Act):** Understanding the ReAct framework for combining reasoning and acting.
*   **MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge, and Language):** An overview of the MRKL architecture.
*   **Self-Correction:** How to build agents that can correct their own mistakes.
*   **Comparing Architectures:** The pros and cons of different agent architectures.

## 🚀 Today's Goal

Today, you will go beyond simple agents and learn about the powerful architectural patterns that enable agents to reason, act, and even correct themselves.

## 🤖 Prompt Examples

*   **Conceptual:** "Explain the ReAct framework to me as if I were a project manager. What are the key benefits?"
*   **Practical:** "How would you implement a self-correction mechanism in a LangChain agent?"
*   **Design:** "Design an agent that uses the MRKL architecture to answer complex questions that require both knowledge and reasoning."

## 💡 Today's Dictionary

*   **ReAct:** A paradigm that combines reasoning and acting to enable agents to solve complex tasks.
*   **MRKL:** A modular architecture for agents that separates the tasks of reasoning, knowledge retrieval, and language generation.
*   **Self-Correction:** The ability of an agent to identify and correct its own mistakes.
