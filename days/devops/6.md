# Day 6: Version Control with Git - Basics

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Version Control:** Learn what version control is and why Git is essential for modern software development.
2.  **Initialize a Git Repository:** Use `git init` to create a new Git repository in a project directory.
3.  **Stage Changes:** Use `git add` to move changes from the working directory to the staging area.
4.  **Commit Changes:** Use `git commit` to record staged changes as a new snapshot in the repository's history.
5.  **Check Status and History:** Use `git status` to see the state of your working directory and `git log` to view the commit history.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes, and it provides a complete history of every change made.

Today, you'll learn the fundamental commands to start using Git. You'll initialize a repository, which tells Git to start tracking changes in that directory. You'll then learn the two-step process of `git add` (staging changes) and `git commit` (saving changes). `git status` will be your constant companion, showing you what's changed, and `git log` will let you review your project's history.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a fundamental understanding of Git and be able to track changes in your local projects. You'll be able to create snapshots of your work, review your history, and understand the basic workflow of version control. This is an indispensable skill for any developer, especially in a collaborative DevOps environment.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Git:** A free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
*   **Repository (Repo):** A directory where Git stores all the files, history, and metadata for a project.
*   **Commit:** A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes.
*   **Staging Area (Index):** An intermediate area where you prepare changes before committing them. `git add` moves changes to the staging area.
*   **Working Directory:** The directory on your file system where you are currently working on your project files.
