# Day 3: Linux Fundamentals - Permissions and Users

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand File Permissions:** Learn about the three types of permissions (read, write, execute) and the three categories of users (owner, group, others).
2.  **Change Permissions with `chmod`:** Practice using `chmod` with both symbolic (e.g., `u+x`, `go-w`) and octal (e.g., `755`) modes to modify file and directory permissions.
3.  **Change Ownership with `chown`:** Learn how to change the owner and group of files and directories.
4.  **Execute Commands with `sudo`:** Understand the purpose of `sudo` (superuser do) for executing commands with root privileges.
5.  **Identify Current User and ID:** Use `whoami` and `id` to determine your current user and group memberships.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Security and access control are paramount in any server environment. Today, you'll delve into Linux file permissions and user management, which are fundamental for securing your systems and ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify specific files and resources.

You'll learn how to interpret and modify permissions using `chmod`, a critical skill for making files executable or protecting sensitive data. `chown` allows you to transfer ownership, which is important when setting up services or managing user accounts. `sudo` is your gateway to administrative tasks, enabling you to temporarily gain root privileges for necessary operations, while `whoami` and `id` help you understand your current identity and privileges.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a solid understanding of Linux file permissions and user management. You'll be able to securely manage access to files and directories, execute commands with elevated privileges responsibly, and understand the security implications of different permission settings. This knowledge is vital for maintaining the integrity and security of your deployments.
