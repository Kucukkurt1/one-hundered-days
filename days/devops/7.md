# Day 7: Version Control with Git - Branching

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Branching:** Learn what a branch is in Git and why it's a fundamental concept for collaborative development.
2.  **Create and List Branches:** Use `git branch` to create new branches and `git branch -a` to list all local and remote branches.
3.  **Switch Branches:** Use `git checkout` to switch between different branches.
4.  **Merge Branches:** Learn how to use `git merge` to integrate changes from one branch into another.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Branching is one of Git's most powerful features. It allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work in isolation without affecting the main codebase. This is incredibly useful for developing new features, fixing bugs, or experimenting with new ideas without disrupting the stable version of your project.

Today, you'll learn how to create new branches for your work, switch between them, and then integrate your changes back into another branch using `git merge`. This workflow is central to how teams collaborate on code, allowing multiple developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to effectively use Git branches to manage different lines of development. You'll understand how to work on features in isolation and how to integrate your changes back into the main project, which is a crucial skill for collaborative software development and a core practice in DevOps.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Branch:** A lightweight movable pointer to one of your commits. It represents an independent line of development.
*   **`git branch`:** Command to create, list, or delete branches.
*   **`git checkout`:** Command to switch branches or restore working tree files.
*   **`git merge`:** Command to integrate changes from a named branch into the current branch.
