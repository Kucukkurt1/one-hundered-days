# Day 10: Version Control with Git - Practice Project

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new empty directory for a small project (e.g., a simple website with an `index.html` and `style.css`).
2.  **Initialize Git:** Initialize a new Git repository in this directory.
3.  **Initial Commit:** Add your initial project files and make your first commit.
4.  **Feature Branching:** Create a new branch for a new feature (e.g., `feature/navbar`).
5.  **Develop Feature:** Make some changes on the feature branch (e.g., add a navigation bar to `index.html`, style it in `style.css`), and make several commits.
6.  **Merge Feature:** Switch back to the main branch and merge your feature branch into it.
7.  **Simulate Conflict (Optional but Recommended):** On both the main branch and a new feature branch, modify the same line of code. Try to merge the feature branch into main and resolve the conflict.
8.  **Remote Repository:** Create a new empty repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
9.  **Connect and Push:** Add the remote repository to your local Git config and push your main branch to the remote.
10. **Pull and Fetch:** Simulate a change on the remote (e.g., edit a file directly on GitHub), then `git fetch` and `git pull` to bring those changes locally.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is all about hands-on application of everything you've learned about Git. You'll go through the entire Git workflow, from initializing a repository to pushing changes to a remote. This practical exercise is crucial for solidifying your understanding and building muscle memory for common Git commands.

The optional conflict simulation is highly recommended. Resolving conflicts is a common occurrence in team environments, and practicing it now will make you much more confident when it happens in a real project. Interacting with a remote repository will complete your understanding of how Git facilitates collaboration.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a comprehensive, practical understanding of Git. You'll be able to confidently manage your code, collaborate with others, handle branching and merging, and interact with remote repositories. This mastery of Git is a fundamental and indispensable skill for any developer or DevOps professional.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Review of Previous Terms:**
    *   **`git init`:** Initializes a new Git repository.

    *   **`git commit`:** Records changes to the repository.
    *   **`git branch`:** Manages branches.
    *   **`git checkout`:** Switches branches.
    *   **`git merge`:** Integrates changes from one branch to another.
    *   **`git clone`:** Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
    *   **`git push`:** Uploads local commits to a remote.
    *   **`git pull`:** Fetches and merges changes from a remote.
    *   **`git fetch`:** Downloads changes from a remote without merging.
    *   **Merge Conflict:** Occurs when Git can't automatically merge changes.
    *   **`git rebase`:** Rewrites commit history to integrate changes linearly.
