# Day 1: Linux Fundamentals - Basic Navigation and File Management

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Connect to a Linux Environment:** Access a Linux terminal (e.g., via WSL, a virtual machine, or a cloud instance).
2.  **Navigate the File System:** Use `ls` (list directory contents), `cd` (change directory), and `pwd` (print working directory).
3.  **Create and Remove Directories:** Practice with `mkdir` (make directory) and `rmdir` (remove empty directory).
4.  **Create, Copy, Move, and Delete Files:** Use `touch` (create empty file), `cp` (copy), `mv` (move/rename), and `rm` (remove) commands.

## 📖 Task Explanations

As a DevOps professional, a deep understanding of Linux is foundational. Today, you'll get comfortable with the command-line interface (CLI) by learning essential commands for navigating and managing files and directories. These commands are your primary tools for interacting with servers and managing codebases.

`ls` helps you see what's in a directory, `cd` lets you move around, and `pwd` tells you where you are. You'll create and delete directories and files, and learn how to copy and move them. Mastering these basic operations will make you efficient and confident when working in any Linux-based environment.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will have a solid grasp of fundamental Linux commands for file system navigation and management. You'll be comfortable interacting with the command line, which is a critical skill for any DevOps role, enabling you to efficiently manage server environments and project files.
