# Day 9: Version Control with Git - Conflict Resolution and Rebase

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Merge Conflicts:** Learn what a merge conflict is and why it occurs.
2.  **Resolve Merge Conflicts:** Practice resolving conflicts that arise when Git cannot automatically merge divergent changes.
3.  **Understand `git rebase`:** Learn what `git rebase` does and how it differs from `git merge`.
4.  **Use `git rebase`:** Practice using `git rebase` to integrate changes from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.

## 📖 Task Explanations

In collaborative development, it's inevitable that multiple people will make changes to the same lines of code. When Git tries to combine these divergent changes, it sometimes can't figure out which changes to keep, leading to a "merge conflict." Today, you'll learn how to identify, understand, and manually resolve these conflicts, a crucial skill for any team member.

You'll also be introduced to `git rebase`, an alternative to `git merge` for integrating changes. While `merge` preserves history, `rebase` rewrites it to create a cleaner, linear commit history. Understanding when to use `merge` versus `rebase` is a key decision in maintaining a project's Git history.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to confidently resolve merge conflicts in Git, ensuring smooth integration of code changes. You'll also understand the power and implications of `git rebase` for maintaining a clean and linear project history. These advanced Git skills are essential for efficient and effective team collaboration.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Merge Conflict:** A situation that occurs when Git is unable to automatically combine changes from two different branches because they have modified the same lines in the same file.
*   **`git rebase`:** A command that integrates changes from one branch onto another by moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
*   **`git merge`:** A command that integrates changes from a named branch into the current branch, creating a new merge commit.
