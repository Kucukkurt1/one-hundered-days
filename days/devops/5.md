# Day 5: Linux Fundamentals & Shell Scripting - Basic Shell Scripting Introduction

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Shell Scripting:** Learn what shell scripting is and its role in automation.
2.  **Create Your First Script:** Write a simple shell script (e.g., `hello.sh`) that prints a message.
3.  **Make a Script Executable:** Learn how to use `chmod` to make your script executable.
4.  **Use Variables in Scripts:** Define and use variables within your shell scripts.
5.  **Basic Input/Output:** Use `echo` for output and `read` to get user input within a script.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks and orchestrating complex operations in a Linux environment. Instead of typing commands one by one, you can write a sequence of commands in a script and execute them all at once. This is a cornerstone of DevOps, enabling you to automate deployments, backups, and system maintenance.

Today, you'll write your very first shell script. You'll learn about the `shebang` line (`#!/bin/bash`), which tells the system which interpreter to use. You'll also learn how to make your script executable and how to use variables to store data. Basic input and output (`echo` and `read`) will allow your scripts to interact with the user or provide feedback.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to write and execute simple shell scripts. You'll understand how to automate basic tasks, use variables, and interact with the user from within a script. This foundational skill in shell scripting will significantly boost your productivity and open doors to more advanced automation.
