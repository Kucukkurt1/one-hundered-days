# Day 4: Linux Fundamentals - Environment Variables and Processes

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Environment Variables:** Learn what environment variables are and how they store configuration information for your shell and programs.
2.  **View and Set Variables:** Use `echo` to display variable values, `export` to set new environment variables, and `env` to list all current environment variables.
3.  **Monitor Processes with `ps` and `top`:** Learn how to view running processes using `ps` (process status) and `top` (real-time process monitoring).
4.  **Manage Processes with `kill`:** Understand how to terminate processes using the `kill` command and different signal types.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today, you'll explore two critical aspects of Linux system management: environment variables and processes. Environment variables are dynamic named values that affect the way running processes behave. They are essential for configuring your shell, defining paths to executables, and passing settings to applications without hardcoding them.

Understanding processes is fundamental for managing any running system. You'll learn how to list and inspect processes using `ps` and `top`, which are invaluable tools for monitoring system health and identifying resource-intensive applications. Finally, you'll learn how to gracefully (or forcefully) terminate processes using `kill`, a necessary skill for troubleshooting and system maintenance.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to configure your Linux shell environment using environment variables and effectively monitor and manage running processes. This knowledge is crucial for debugging applications, optimizing system performance, and ensuring the stability of your deployments.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Environment Variable:** A dynamic named value that can affect the way running processes will behave in a computer operating system.
*   **Process:** An instance of a computer program that is being executed.
*   **PID (Process ID):** A unique identification number assigned to each running process.
*   **`echo`:** Command to display a line of text/string that is passed as an argument.
*   **`export`:** Command to set an environment variable so that it is available to child processes.
*   **`env`:** Command to display all environment variables.
*   **`ps`:** (process status) Command to display information about currently running processes.
*   **`top`:** Command to display a dynamic, real-time view of running processes.
*   **`kill`:** Command to send a signal to a process, typically to terminate it.
