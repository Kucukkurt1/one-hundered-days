# Day 10: Data Handling & Validation Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Review Your CRUD API:** Go over the API you have built over the last few days.
2.  **Ensure DTOs Are Used Everywhere:** Make sure that all of your endpoints that receive data are using DTOs.
3.  **Ensure Validation is in Place:** Verify that all of your DTOs have appropriate validation rules.
4.  **Add a Complex Validation:** Try to implement a more complex validation scenario, such as conditional validation or nested DTOs.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about reinforcing what you have learned about data handling and validation. You will review your existing code to ensure that you are following best practices. You will also challenge yourself to implement a more complex validation scenario. This will solidify your understanding of these important concepts and prepare you for building real-world applications.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

A deep and practical understanding of how to handle data persistence, data transfer, and validation in a professional and secure manner. You will be well-equipped to build the data layer of any NestJS application.
