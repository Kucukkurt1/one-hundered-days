# Day 6: Database Integration with TypeORM

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Install TypeORM and Database Driver:** Add TypeORM and the appropriate database driver (e.g., `pg` for PostgreSQL) to your project.
2.  **Configure the Database Connection:** Set up the `TypeOrmModule` in your application to connect to a local or remote database.
3.  **Define an Entity:** Create a TypeORM entity that represents a table in your database.
4.  **Inject the Repository:** Use the `@InjectRepository()` decorator to inject the repository for your entity into a service.

## 📖 Task Explanations

It's time to connect your application to a real database! Today, you will learn how to use TypeORM, a popular Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), to manage your database interactions. You will set up a database connection, define your data models as entities, and learn how to access the database through repositories. This is a critical step towards building a full-fledged application.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to integrate a database into your NestJS application, allowing you to persist data. You will understand the basics of TypeORM and how it maps your objects to database tables.
