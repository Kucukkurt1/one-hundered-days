# Day 4: Basic Routing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Implement Different HTTP Methods:** Create handlers for `@Post()`, `@Put()`, and `@Delete()` requests.
2.  **Handle Route Parameters:** Create a route that captures a dynamic value from the URL (e.g., `/users/:id`).
3.  **Handle Query Parameters:** Create a route that accepts optional query parameters (e.g., `/users?role=admin`).
4.  **Handle Request Body:** Create a POST or PUT route that accepts data in the request body.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Building a useful API requires more than just GET requests. Today, you will expand your routing knowledge to include all the common HTTP methods. You will also learn how to make your routes dynamic by capturing parameters from the URL and how to work with query strings and request bodies. These are the fundamental skills needed to build any REST API.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

After today, you will be able to build a comprehensive set of endpoints for a resource, including the ability to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data. You will be comfortable extracting any information you need from an incoming request.
