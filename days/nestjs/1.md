# Day 1: Introduction to NestJS and CLI

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Install NestJS CLI:** Install the NestJS command-line interface globally on your machine.
2.  **Create a New NestJS Project:** Use the CLI to generate a new "hello-world" application.
3.  **Explore the Project Structure:** Familiarize yourself with the default files and directories created by the CLI.
4.  **Start the Development Server:** Run the application and see the default endpoint in your browser or API client.

## 📖 Task Explanations

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. Today is all about getting your environment set up and creating your first application. The NestJS CLI is a powerful tool that helps you scaffold projects, generate code, and manage your application. Understanding the project structure is key to knowing where to place your code and how the different parts of the application fit together.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will be able to create a new NestJS application from scratch, understand the basic project layout, and run it locally. This is the first step to building powerful backends with NestJS.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **CLI (Command-Line Interface):** A tool that allows you to interact with a program from the command line.
*   **Module:** In NestJS, a module is a class with the `@Module()` decorator. It provides a way to organize the application structure and manage dependencies.
*   **Controller:** Controllers are responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client.
*   **Provider:** Providers are a fundamental concept in NestJS. Many of the basic NestJS classes may be treated as a provider – services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on.
