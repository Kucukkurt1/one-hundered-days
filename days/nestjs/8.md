# Day 8: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand the Purpose of DTOs:** Learn why it is important to separate your internal data models (entities) from the data you expose to the outside world.
2.  **Create DTOs:** Create classes to be used as Data Transfer Objects for your create and update operations.
3.  **Use DTOs in Your Controller:** Type-hint the `@Body()` of your controller methods with your new DTOs.
4.  **Learn about `class-transformer`:** See how you can use this library to transform plain request objects into instances of your DTO classes.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are a crucial pattern for building robust and maintainable APIs. They allow you to define a clear contract for the data that your API expects and returns. This decouples your API from your internal database structure, making it more flexible and easier to evolve. Today, you will learn how to create and use DTOs in your NestJS application.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will understand how to create a stable and well-defined API by using DTOs. This will improve the security and maintainability of your application.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **DTO (Data Transfer Object):** An object that is used to encapsulate data and send it from one part of an application to another.
*   **`class-transformer`:** A library that can be used to transform plain objects to instances of a class, and vice-versa.
