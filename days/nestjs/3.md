# Day 3: Providers and Services

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a New Service:** Use the NestJS CLI to generate a service within your feature module.
2.  **Inject the Service:** Inject the newly created service into your controller.
3.  **Move Business Logic:** Refactor your route handler to call a method on the service to handle the core logic.
4.  **Understand Dependency Injection:** Explore how NestJS automatically manages the instantiation and injection of your service.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Providers, and more specifically Services, are a core concept in NestJS. They are responsible for encapsulating business logic, keeping your controllers lean and focused on handling HTTP requests. Today, you will learn how to create a service and use NestJS's powerful Dependency Injection (DI) system to provide it to your controller. This separation of concerns is crucial for writing testable and maintainable code.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

By the end of today, you will understand how to properly structure your application's logic by separating it into services. You will also have a foundational understanding of how Dependency Injection works in NestJS, which is a key pattern for building robust applications.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`@Injectable()`:** A decorator that marks a class as a provider that can be managed by the NestJS IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
*   **Dependency Injection (DI):** A design pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself.
*   **Service:** A type of provider that is typically used to encapsulate business logic.
