# Day 5: NestJS Fundamentals Review

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Build a Simple CRUD API:** Create a complete API for a new resource (e.g., "tasks").
2.  **Create the Feature Module:** Generate a `TasksModule`, `TasksController`, and `TasksService`.
3.  **Implement All CRUD Operations:** Write handlers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
4.  **Use In-Memory Storage:** For now, simply store the data in an array within your service.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about putting everything you've learned together. You will build a simple but complete API from scratch. This will reinforce your understanding of modules, controllers, services, routing, and data handling. By the end of this exercise, you will have a solid foundation in the core concepts of NestJS.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

A practical, hands-on understanding of how to build a feature in a NestJS application. You will be confident in your ability to create well-structured and functional API endpoints.
