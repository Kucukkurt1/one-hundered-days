# Day 9: Validation

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Install `class-validator`:** Add the `class-validator` library to your project.
2.  **Add Validation Decorators:** Use decorators from `class-validator` (e.g., `@IsString()`, `@IsNotEmpty()`) to add validation rules to your DTOs.
3.  **Use the `ValidationPipe`:** Apply the `ValidationPipe` globally or to specific endpoints to enable automatic validation.
4.  **Customize Error Messages:** Learn how to provide custom error messages for your validation rules.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Never trust user input! Validation is a critical security measure for any application. Today, you will learn how to use the powerful `class-validator` library in combination with NestJS's `ValidationPipe` to automatically validate incoming data based on your DTOs. This allows you to declaratively define your validation rules and keep your application safe from invalid data.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will be able to build secure and robust APIs that are protected against common data-related vulnerabilities. You will have a solid understanding of how to implement declarative and automatic validation in NestJS.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`class-validator`:** A library that provides a set of decorators for validating properties of objects.
*   **`ValidationPipe`:** A built-in NestJS pipe that uses `class-validator` and `class-transformer` to automatically validate and transform incoming data.
