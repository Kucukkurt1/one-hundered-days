# Day 2: Modules and Controllers

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Create a New Module:** Use the NestJS CLI to generate a new module for a feature (e.g., `users`).
2.  **Create a New Controller:** Generate a controller for the new module.
3.  **Define a Basic Route:** Implement a simple GET route in your new controller.
4.  **Connect to the Root Module:** Import your new feature module into the main `AppModule`.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Modules are the building blocks of a NestJS application. They help you organize your code into cohesive blocks of functionality. Controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests. By creating a `UsersModule` and a `UsersController`, you are starting to build a feature-oriented and organized codebase, which is a best practice in NestJS.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

Today, you will learn how to create and wire up the basic building blocks of a NestJS application. You will understand how to create new features in a modular way and how to expose functionality via HTTP endpoints.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **`@Module()`:** A decorator that marks a class as a module and provides metadata that NestJS uses to organize the application structure.
*   **`@Controller()`:** A decorator that marks a class as a controller, allowing it to handle incoming requests.
*   **`@Get()`:** A decorator that marks a method as a handler for HTTP GET requests.
