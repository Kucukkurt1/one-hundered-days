# Day 7: CRUD Operations with TypeORM

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Refactor Your Service:** Replace the in-memory array in your service with the injected TypeORM repository.
2.  **Implement Create:** Use the `repository.save()` method to create new records in the database.
3.  **Implement Read:** Use `repository.find()` and `repository.findOne()` to retrieve records.
4.  **Implement Update and Delete:** Use the `repository.update()` and `repository.delete()` methods to modify and remove records.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Now that you have a database connection, it's time to use it. Today, you will refactor your existing CRUD API to use TypeORM for data persistence. You will learn the basic repository methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. This will make your API much more powerful and useful.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will have a fully functional CRUD API that interacts with a real database. You will be comfortable with the fundamental TypeORM repository methods for managing data.
